+ Data Science is the science of analyzing raw data using statistics and machine
learning techniques with the purpose of drawing insights from the data

« Data Science is used in many industries to allow them to make better business
decisions, and in the sciences to test models or theories

+ This requires a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, modeling, analyzing, and
interpreting raw data

Advantages of Python

Provides good ecosystem of libraries that are robust
and varied

© Tight knit integration with big data frameworks like
Hadoop, Spark etc

Supports both object oriented and functional
programming paradigms

¢ Python is reasonably fast to prototype

Provides support for reading files from local,
databases and cloud
